    Sign up
    Set name, country, use making a bot, no to question, next, check and submit, confirm your email
    Set app name, do not copy keys yet

3. Get API keys

    Developer portal
    User authentication settings / Set up
    Turn on OAuth 2.0 and 1.0a
    Type of App Automated App or bot
    App permissions Read and Write
    Callback URI: http://localhost:3000
    Website URL just type one
    Save
    Make sure about permissions again
    Go to project / Keys and tokens
    API Key and Secret / Re-Generate / Save them
    Authentication Tokens / Access Token and Secret / Generate / Save them

4. Create python script (fill keys and tokens)

        import tweepy

        API_KEY = 
        API_KEY_SECRET = 
        ACCESS_TOKEN = 
        ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET =

        tweet = 'Hello world!'

        client = tweepy.Client(consumer_key=API_KEY, consumer_secret=API_KEY_SECRET, access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN, access_token_secret=ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
        client.create_tweet(text=tweet)

    Save file as mybot.py
    If you get 'tweepy.errors.Unauthorized: 401 Unauthorized', then regenerate all keys 

    Create requirements.txt
    use pip show module_1, module_n to check library versions, for example:

        tweepy==4.10.0
        python-dotenv==0.20.0

5. Configure AWS

    Create AWS account

    https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email

    Credit card will be asked, as in 2024 you have 750 h free/month for a year, that is more thna enough

    Go to EC2 service
    Lunch a new instance
    Write a name (twitter bot for example)
    AMI: Amazon Linux 2023 AMI (make sure it is free tier eligible)
    Arquitecture: 64 bits (x86)
    Instance type: t2.micro (make sure it is free tier eligible)
    Create new key pair: aws as name, RSA as type and .pem as format, and create key pair, a file will be downloaded
    Network settings / Allow SSH trafic from / My IP
    Finally Lunch Instance

6. Connect and configure EC2

    Connect to EC2
    Open a console, go to where the aws.pem file is and run:

        ssh -i "aws.pem" ec2-user@ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com

    Then in the EC2 run:

        sudo yum -y install python-pip

    Make sure you have python with:

        python3 -V

7. Configure App

    Still in the EC2:

        mkdir mybot

    Now go back to local (your laptop) where the aws.pem file is and transfer files:

        scp -i "aws.pem" mybot.py ec2-user@ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:~/mybot
        scp -i "aws.pem" requirements.txt ec2-user@ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:~/mybot

    Go back to EC2

    At the end of ~/.bashrc write these environmental variables (include export on each variable) and more if you need to:

        vi ~/.bashrc

        export API_KEY=FILL
        export API_KEY_SECRET=FILL
        export ACCESS_TOKEN=FILL
        export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=FILL

    Import new variables as:

        source ~/.bashrc

8. Run App

        cd mybot
        chmod 750 mybot.py
        nohup python3 mybot.py &

    Now you can logout with Ctrl + D
